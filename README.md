# Speech-to-Text-Project

This project is a Speech-to-text translation system that uses audio and language models to transcribe speech into text. It is built using Python and the Kaldi ASR toolkit, and can be used for various speech recognition tasks, such as transcribing audio recordings or live speech input.


Installation
To install the system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
* git clone https://github.com/your_username/Speech-to-Text-Project.git
* cd speech-to-text

2. Install the dependencies:
* pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the pre-trained models:
- The pre-trained models for the ASR and language models can be downloaded from the following links:

ASR model: [link to ASR model]
Language model: [link to language model]
Download the models and place them in the models directory.

Usage
To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Convert audio to WAV format:
The audio data needs to be in the WAV format for the system to work. You can use a tool like 

ffmpeg to convert the audio to WAV format:
* ffmpeg -i audio.mp3 audio.wav

2. Transcribe the audio:

To transcribe the audio, run the following command:
* python transcribe.py audio.wav

This will produce a text transcription of the audio.

Customization
The system can be customized to work with different audio and language models. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Collect audio data:
Collect audio data that is representative of the speech patterns and accents of the intended audience.

2. Train the ASR and language models:
Train the ASR and language models using the audio data and text data. This can be done using the Kaldi toolkit or other ASR and language model training tools.

3. Replace the pre-trained models:
Replace the pre-trained models in the models directory with the custom-trained models.

4. Modify the transcribe.py script:
Modify the transcribe.py script to use the new ASR and language models.
